The context or theme of the database is going to track the prices and the ability to be mined along with volume of market and amount of cryptocoins available for that specific coin.

My goal is to find the most optimal coins for an investment or just to keep an eye on in case they become worth something in the real world, Bitcoin obviously is in the mainstream, but not untrackable like most people used to think. I am looking for better coins with safer algorythyms in their blockchain. Ultimetely I want to find the best coin for mineing that has a good supply that is not main stream but may become mainstream. By mainstream I mean
starting to be accepted as currency at retail stores or online and not just a gambling investement for kids like me.

I got the data from Data.world and have created an account linked to my github repository here.
