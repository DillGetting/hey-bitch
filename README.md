# DataFORbase

I collected a new set of data about the minability of a good number of coins.
I put the data into the spreadsheet with first normal form in the name as a reference.

each entity has a primary key of id. or id and the file name to check for that information.
That means each file in this repository has the primary key of id, and a foreign key of the file name. 
except for the one mentioned with first normal form in the title.
